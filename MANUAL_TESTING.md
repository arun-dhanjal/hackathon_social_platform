## Notes

- All tests should be performed on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Tests should be repeated at different screen sizes
- Any failures should be documented with screenshots and steps to reproduce
- Test both as authenticated and unauthenticated users where applicable
- Verify all success/error messages display correctly
- Check that all modals can be closed properly
- Ensure pagination works correctly on all list views
